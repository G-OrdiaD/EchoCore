### Voice-Powered Independence for Aging Communities

EchoCore is an **offline-first voice assistant** designed to help older adults in rural areas manage their daily tasks with simplicity and dignity. Unlike cloud-based assistants, EchoCore requires no internet connection, protects privacy completely, and features a simple, high-contrast interface designed for clarity and ease of use.

> **The Problem:** Many older adults in rural communities struggle with digital isolation, complex smartphone interfaces, and unreliable internet access. This can make simple tasks like setting a medication reminder or checking the date a significant challenge.
>
> **Our Solution:** EchoCore. By leveraging natural voice commands on an affordable, low-power device (like a Raspberry Pi), we provide a reliable and accessible tool for daily living that promotes independence and reduces cognitive load.
